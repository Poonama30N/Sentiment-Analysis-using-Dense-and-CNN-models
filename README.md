# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Dense-and-CNN-models
This project aims to classify 1,600,000 automatically annotated tweets as positive or negative
using two machine learning models based on Neural Networks. The models used are a sequential
Dense model and a Convolutional Neural Network with accuracies around 77-78%.
